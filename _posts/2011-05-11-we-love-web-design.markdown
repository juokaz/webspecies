Even though we are not a design agency we still believe that web design is a crucial element for all websites. Content is very important, but first impression is always visual and good design is esential for success. Thatâ€™s why we have spent **a lot** of time building our website and are very excited about the feedback we have received.

Last week our website was featured, blogged about and listed in dozens of web design blogs and galleries. For example these are just a few to mention:

* One of the biggest websites gallery [CSSMania](http://www.cssmania.com/galleries/2011/05/02/web-species)
* Russian design blog [Naikom](http://naikom.ru/blog/archives/3705)
* Japan designer's Motoshi Goto [straightline bookmarks](http://bm.straightline.jp/detail/9778c4fe7c7cf2711080f1c63fa1af8a)
* French design blog [Xbition-art](http://www.blog.xbition-art.fr/2011/05/three-sites-of-the-week-22/)
* UK websites gallery [designfridge](http://www.designfridge.co.uk/inspiration/minimal/web-species)
* Lithuanian websites gallery [BEST WEB](http://www.bestweb.lt/Web_Species_Ltd.)
* Very popular gallery [MakeBetterWebsites](http://www.makebetterwebsites.com/2011/05/02/web-species/)
* Another design gallery [CSSDSGN](http://www.cssdsgn.com/web-species/)

This is just to show that if we are going to have a project done for you in a future, we are going to make sure design is top notch also. Need a web project done?
