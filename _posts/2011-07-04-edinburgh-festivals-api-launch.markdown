This summer we partnered with [Edinburgh Festivals Innovation Lab](http://festivalslab.com/) to build an API for all events happening in the summer festival. The Edinburgh Festival is the largest cultural event in the world, so we are very excited to be part of this experience for Edinburgh residents and visitors. It went live publicly today and is being integrated into various apps, websites and data visualisations as you read this.

It was fun couple months building it and we are sharing more of this story in our blog [here](http://blog.webspecies.co.uk/2011-07-04/building-the-edinburgh-festival-api.html). From technology perspective it was an interesting challenge, because we needed to process, store and distribute data from various different sources all with different formats and requirements. In the end we built something we are very happy with and which works flawlessly.

As with all APIs it can't be easily showcased, because it's just an endpoint for other applications to get data from. It's accessible at [http://api.festivalslab.com/](http://api.festivalslab.com/), but that is just a documentation page for the developers and a starting point of the API. We will update this news story once we get some application using the API, we know there will be a lot of them.

This is just a pilot year for this API and the plan is to make it even bigger, better and open next year; open data is an ever-growing movement and being part of it is a delightful experience. We can help you achieve this, <a href="contact.html" class="menu-link">speak</a> to us!
