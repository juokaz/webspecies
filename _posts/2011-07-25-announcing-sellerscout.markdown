Today we are very excited to introduce our first <a href="/products" class="menu-link">product</a> - [SellerScout](http://sellerscout.co.uk/). It's not quite ready to be released yet, but we are working hard to make this happen before the end of the summer.

We are a web development company and we work on various different projects four our clients, but when we see opportunities we invest our resources to building products ourselves. This is a first of hopefully much more to come.

SellerScout is a competitor price monitoring service for e-commerce stores, allowing getting real-time information about market prices, how they are changing and how one's store compares to competitors'. The key sentence describing it is this:

<blockquote>"If you have been selling online long enough you will know that having the best price is the key to success."</blockquote>

Lately we have been talking about SellerScout with some of our clients and we received great interest, thus we are sharing it as a minimal website today. Basic information is quite well described in the [website](http://sellerscout.co.uk/), but if you'd like to know more - please feel free to let us know. There are exciting features coming along and we sure hope it's going to be very useful for our e-commerce clients.
