				<h2>Web Species Ltd provides bespoke <strong>software solutions</strong>, <strong>consulting</strong> and <strong>training services</strong> based on our open-source technologies expertise</h2>
				<p>
					Based in <strong>Edinburgh, UK</strong> we were established in late 2010 to create software solutions and provide services centred on web technologies. We think web is the future, more and more applications will be accessible using web interface and online presence is a requirement for any modern business, so our goal is to help with this using our years and years of experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Internet allows markets to be expanded, thus we do not focus on UK only and a lot of our clients are Europe and USA based companies. We are young, determined and very professional - our main priority is always the customer, you, and we will work hard to suit your needs. If needed, we can even fly to anywhere you are located and have a chat.
